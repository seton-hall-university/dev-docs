## Procedures

After logging into Omni CMS, navigate to the Add-On's menu and select `Emergency Alerts` 

![[omnicms-addons-emergency-alerts-20231005183003.png]]

Once the add-on has loaded, you will be presented with either the currently active message or the ability to create a new alert.

![[omnicms-addons-emergency-alerts-active-20231005182704.png]]

![[omnicms-addons-emergency-alerts-new-202310061530.png]]

From this screen you have the ability to review the active alert, settings and archived alerts. You can edit the existing alert, add a new update, or edit an existing update. 

> [!warning]
> Please note, you can only have one (1) active alert at a time. You can issue as many updates as needed to the active alert.

### Create a New Alert

Selecting the `New Alert` button at the bottom of the screen provides the ability to create a new alert. Once opened, you can add the severity of the alert, add a title, subtitle, description, time and a URL for the alert to link to. All of the fields except for the `subtitle` and `URL` are **required**. However, you will need to put a URL in based on our standard operating procedures.

> [!info]
> Please note that our current UI/X for emergency messages **does not** display the date, subtitle or description.

There are current three (3) severity levels:

- Announcement
- Emergency
- Warning

Once you are satisfied with the alert, publish it with the <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">green publish button</span> at the bottom of the page. Once published, the alert will be active on designated pages.

### Activate an Archived Alert

If there is a need to reuse a previously published alert, it can be reactivated by selecting the `Archived Alerts` link on the left side of the `Emergency Alerts` dashboard.

![[omnicms-addons-emergency-alerts-archive-20231009125906.png]]

Selecting an archived alert allows you to either set it as active or delete it. 

![[omnicms-addons-emergency-alerts-activate-20231009130431.png]]

Once you select the alert to make active, select `SET AS ACTIVE` to continue. You will be prompted to confirm activating the archived alert.

![[omnicms-addons-emergency-alerts-archive-activate-20231009130743.png]]

Now that the archived alert has been activated it, along with all of the updates, can be edited. All previous updates will also be editable from the `Active Alert` page.

> [!tip] 
> In to order update an “Archived” Alert, the alert must **first** be made active on the site. Once activated, the you are able to make the necessary updates to the content.
> 
> > [!info]-
> > If needed, the settings can be modified so that the alert is not on a live page. Refer to the Admin Guide for instructions on how to change the page alerts are displayed on.

> [!warning]
> Since unarchiving an alert may require a content edit, it's worth noting that creating a new alert may be simpler. Creating a new alert could also provide time to craft the message as you like without concern for someone seeing an old message.
